# Nmax

This script searches for a specified count of maximum numbers in STDIN from the console or in the application for the object supporting the `each_line` method, for example, from a file.

There are restrictions:

  * the number is a continuous sequence of not more than 1000 digits
  * the count of output numbers is a required parameter of the script

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'nmax-tool'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install nmax-tool

## Usage

From a console:

    $ cat sample_data_40GB.txt | nmax 10000

From an application:

```ruby
required 'nmax/integer'

f = File.new('testfile')
ni = Nmax::Integer.new(10000)

ni.perform(f)
```
